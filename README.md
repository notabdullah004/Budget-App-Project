Budget App Project Python 

The Budget App is a Python-based application for tracking expenses across different budget categories. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between categories. Additionally, the app can generate a text-based chart visualizing spending distribution across categories.

This project is an excellent exercise for object-oriented programming in Python and for working with text formatting and data visualization in the console.
